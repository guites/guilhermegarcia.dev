These are my notes for memory aid and overcomming gotchas while following  <https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide>.

## Arch Linux Installation

1. Download the image via torrent: <https://archlinux.org/download/>
2. Flash to USB using the ISO as is: <https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/USB_flash_installation_medium#Using_macOS_dd>
3. Boot the live environment from the USB
    
    - Inserted the pendrive, booted the PC and used F12 to select the pendrive as the boot device.
    - At this step the screen went black after selecting "Arch Linux Install medium"
    - Added **nomodeset** to the kernel parameter, as pointed out by <https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/727978>. This is done, on the arch linux boot loader menu, by pressing <TAB> and writing `nomodeset`, then pressing enter.
4. Set the console keyboard layout and font

    - `loadkeys br-abnt2`
5. Verify the boot mode

    - the `/sys/firmware/efi/fw_platform_size` file does not exist, indicating that the system booted in BIOS (as expected).
6. Connecting to the internet

    - used `ip link` and verified that my wlan0 adapter is listed
    - used `iwctl` to connect to wifi
7. Update the system clock

    - used `timedatectl set-timezone America/Sao_Paulo`
8. Partition the disks

    - I didn't have to to anything as my disk was already layed out as

            /dev/sda1 2G --> Linux swap
            /dev/sda2 976M --> Extended
            /dev/sda3 295G --> Linux
            /dev/sda5 976M --> Linux swap

        and I'm going to install arch in sda3.
9. Formatting the partitions

    - used `mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3` and `mkswap /dev/sda1`.
10. Mounting the file systems

    - used `mount /dev/sda3` and `swapon /dev/sda1`.
11. Install the base package, Linux kernel and firmware

    - used `pacstrap -K /mnt base linux linux-firmware`.
    - noticed my download speed was too slow (~200KiB/s)
    - <kbd>CTRL^C</kbd> to stop the current process (it will resume where stopped later on)
    - ran `cp /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.backup`
    - ran `reflector --verbose --latest 5 --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist`
    - retry the downloads with `pacstrap -K /mnt base linux linux-firmware` with speeds closer to 2Mib/s
12. Install vim with `packmang -S vim`.
13. Generated an fstab file
14. Changed root to the new system
15. Set the timezone
16. Set the localization

    - Uncommented `en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8` and `pt_BR.UTF-8 UTF-8` lines
    - ran `locale-gen`
    - created `/etc/locale.conf` with `LANG=en_US.UTF-8`.
    - persist keyboard layout by creating `/etc/vconsole.conf` with `KEYMAP=br-abnt2`
17. Set the hostname with `echo whitearchie > /etc/hostname`
18. Set the hostname in the /etc/hosts file

        127.0.0.1 localhost
        ::1       localhost
        127.0.0.1 whitearchie.localdomain whitearchie
19. Complete the networkconfiguration by installing `NetworkManager` with `pacman -S networkmanager` and `systemctl enable NetworkManager`.
20. Set the root password with `passwd`.
21. Configure the bootloader (assuming we are a non UEFI install, or MBR:

    - run `pacman -S grub`
    - run `grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sda`

        > where i386-pc is deliberately used regardless of your actual architecture, and /dev/sdX is the disk (not a partition) where GRUB is to be installed. For example /dev/sda or /dev/nvme0n1, or /dev/mmcblk0
    - generate the grub configuration file with `grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`.
22. Reboot the machine by

    - exiting the chroot environment with `exit`
    - unmounting all the partitions with `umount -R /mnt`
    - reboot with `reboot`
    - remove the pendrive and turn computer on
    - login with previously created root password
23. Initial config is done!

## Setting up the environment

These are necessary house keeping tasks in order to run arch with an internet connection, graphical interface and non privileged user accounts.

### Parallel downloads for pacman

We'll start by **enabling parallel downloads** with pacman. Edit the `/etc/pacman.conf` file and search for `ParallelDownloads` under `[options]`. To enable it, remove the comment (`#`) from the beginning of the line.

I've left the default value of 5.

### Setting the internet connection back

You will notice that after the first reboot, you won't be able to access `iwctl`, and won't have a connection.

Since we installed `networkmanager`,  we have the `nmcli` utility installed.

Start by making sure the `NetworkManager.service` is started and enabled:

```
systemctl status NetworkManager
# if not running
systemctl start NetworkManager
# if not enabled
systemctl enable NetworkManager
```

If you're not sure that network manager is the only network package you've installed, you can check by running:

```
systemctl --type=service
```

and stopping any other network related service in order to avoid conflicts.

List existing wifi networks with `nmcli device wifi list` and connect to your desired network with `nmcli device wifi connect SSDID password my_new_password`.

### System time synchronization via NTP

Check the current time settings with `timedatectl status`.

If **System clock synchronized** show **no**, activate it with

```
timedatectl set-ntp true
```

### Setting up the GUI with i3

Turns out I love tilling window managers. They automatically allocate new windows by dividing existing screen space between applications.

You can also switch between different workspaces, each with its own set of apps.

[i3](https://i3wm.org/) is very similar to other TWM such as [Xmonad](https://xmonad.org/), [awesome](https://awesomewm.org/) or [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) (for macOS).

I'll be using i3 as its what I'm used to on other distros such as Ubuntu, but most X compatible window managers should share the same steps for installation and setting up.

<aside>Also i3 comes at < 100mb against XMonad's 800mb. This is partly due to XMonad requiring most of haskell toolchain dependencies, and it might not be so much if you plan on doing Haskell coding on your pc.</aside> 

Since arch comes with only the cli by default, let's start by installing X, which is on the xorg-server package. We'll include the xorg-init package which contains the helper script `startx` which is used to start X on demand.

```
pacman -S xorg-server xorg-xinit
```

<aside> If you receive errors about mirrors receiving status 404 when trying to download specific packages such as libxfont2, xorg-xkbcomp, etc, try updating the pacman cache with `packman -Syu` and then repeating the commands.</aside>

Now we add the i3 related packages with

```
pacman -S i3-wm i3status dmenu xterm
```

- An application launcher (we'll use [dmenu](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/dmenu))
- A terminal emulator (we'll use [xterm](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xterm))

...and that's about it.

If prompted to choose a set of fonts, any will do (I'm going with the default gnu-free-fonts).

Now we need to inform our system to start X by default, and that X should load the i3 WM. This is done by creating a `~/.xinitrc` file with a single line stating `exec i3`.

Start i3 by running `startx`.

<aside>
    If you want to start i3 automatically on every session, you can add `startx` to your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc file!
</aside>

On your first launch, you'll be prompted to generate a config file at ` ~/.config/i3/config`. Press <kbd>enter</kbd> to accept it. you can also choose between the win (power) key and alt as your modifier (key used to run i3 commands).

#### Setting up the keyboard layout on i3

While previously we've set the layout using /etc/vconsole.conf, in order to apply it to i3, we need to add the following to our i3 config file (defaults to `~/.config/i3/config`):

```bash
echo 'exec "setxkbmap -layout br,us"' >> ~/.config/i3/config
```

You can go back to the cli with <kbd> $mod + shift + e</kbd>.

### Setting up a non root user

It might be sensible to set up a non root user to perform day to day activities on the computer.

In order to allow regular users to escalate privileges when necessary (such as installing a package), we need the `sudo` package.

```bash
pacman -S sudo
```

Now we can add our new user by running

```bash
useradd -m -G wheel user_name
```

The `-G wheel` option adds the newly created user to the `wheel` group.

<aside>The **wheel** group in arch acts as the **sudo** group in Ubuntu</aside>

We now need to allow users in the `wheel` group to run commands using `sudo`. This is done by uncommenting (removing the `#`) from the `/etc/sudoers` file.

```
#%wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

<aside><strong>Warning!</strong> do not edit the `/etc/sudoers` file directly. Any syntax errors would prevent you from running `sudo` commands and lead to great headache.

Instead, use `EDITOR=vim visudo /etc/sudoers` (change `vim` for your editor of choice, eg `nano`).

`visudo` checks for syntax errors before saving the file and prevents common typos from locking you out.</aside>

The last step is setting a password for your new user.

```bash
passwd new_user
```

Our last step is setting the default configuration files to our new user.

```bash
cp ~/.xinitrc /home/new_user/.xinitrc
mkdir -p /home/new_user/.config/i3
cp ~/.config/i3/config /home/new_user/.config/i3/config
echo startx >> /home/new_user/.bash_profile # optional!
```

Now you can safely reboot your machine and, this time, log in with your non root user.
